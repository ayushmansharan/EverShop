### Setting Up the Environment

#### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/EverShop.git
cd EverShop
```

#### 2. Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root of both the backend and frontend directories. Use the following template for your backend:
```env
PORT=4000
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=your_postgres_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_postgres_password
DB_NAME=evershop_db
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

For the frontend, specify the backend API URL:
```env
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:4000/graphql
```

#### 3. Install Dependencies
Navigate to the backend and frontend directories and install the required dependencies:

**Backend**:
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

**Frontend**:
```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

### Database Setup

1. Log in to PostgreSQL and create a database:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE evershop_db;
   ```
2. Run database migrations using Sequelize:
   ```bash

   npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
   ```

### Running the Application

#### 1. Start the Backend Server
```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

#### 2. Start the Frontend
```bash
cd ../frontend
npm start
```

### Deployment

#### Backend Deployment
1. Use a cloud service such as AWS, Heroku, or DigitalOcean to deploy the backend.
2. Set environment variables securely on the cloud platform.
3. Ensure PostgreSQL is configured and accessible from your deployment.

#### Frontend Deployment
1. Deploy the frontend using services like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages.
2. Update the `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` environment variable to point to the deployed backend API.

### Monitoring and Maintenance

- Use tools like **New Relic** or **Prometheus** to monitor performance.
- Set up error tracking with **Sentry**.
- Regularly back up the PostgreSQL database to ensure data integrity.
